# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

A. **Python Basics : What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.**

 Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming (Van Rossum, 2007)

 *Key features of python programing*

 -Readable and Maintainable Code : Python's syntax emphasizes readability, which reduces the cost of program maintenance.

 -Extensive Standard Library : Python's standard library supports many common programming tasks such as connecting to web servers, reading and modifying files, and working with data formats.

 -Interpreted Language : Python is an interpreted language, which means that Python code is executed line by line. This makes debugging easier and faster.

 -Dynamic Typing : Variables in Python do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when a value is assigned to a variable.

 -Portability : Python is available on many operating systems, making it a portable option.

 -Community Support : Python has a large and active community that contributes to a rich ecosystem of third-party packages and frameworks.

*Use Cases :* 
 
 1. Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask make it easy to build web applications.
 
 2. Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow are popular for data analysis and machine learning.
 
 3. Automation and Scripting: Python is widely used for writing small scripts to automate tasks.
 
 4. Software Development: Python is often used as a support language for software developers, for build control and management, testing, and in many other ways.


B. **Installing Python : Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.**

 1. Install Python using the following codes : (sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3)

 2. Verify the Installation using this code : (python3 --version)

 3. Install pip (Python package installer) using the following code : (sudo apt install python3-pip)

 4. Install *venv* for virtual environments using the following code : (sudo apt install python3-venv)

 5. Create a Virtual Environment using the following code : (python3 -m venv myenv)

 6. Activate the Virtual Environment using : (source myenv/bin/activate)

 7. Deactivate the Virtual Environment using  : (deactivate), (Van Rossum, 2007)



C. **Python Syntax and Semantics : Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.**



D. **Data Types and Variables : List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.**

E. **Control Structures : Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.**

F. **Functions in Python : What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.**

G. **Lists and Dictionaries : Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.**

H. **Exception Handling : What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.**

I. **Modules and Packages : Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.**

J. **File I/O : How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.**
